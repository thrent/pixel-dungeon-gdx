=================

GDX port of the awesome [Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon)

This is a fork of Arcnor's GDX port which I pushed to *Pixel Dungeon* 1.9.1.

This fork is focused on the desktop versions, therefore I don't intend to maintain the mobile versions and those are likely to be removed in future.

Quickstart
----------
Download the jar from [here](https://github.com/nojus297/pixel-dungeon-gdx/releases) or build yourself. 

**Building**
 - `./gradlew desktop:run` to run.
 - `./gradlew desktop:run` to compile a jar file (located in `desktop/build/libs/` folder.
